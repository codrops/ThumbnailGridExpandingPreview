				<h1>Native Advertising Examples - Case Studies</h1><br/>
				<span>With banner blindness and ad blockers getting in the way of banner ads, it's no wonder adverisers and brands love native advertising. They seem to generate higher engagement from the audience.</span><br/><br/>
				<span>Native advertising is paid content that matches a publication’s editorial standards while meeting the audience’s expectations. While it may sound like it's no different than an advertorial, there are some key differences. A good native ad should align with the publication or site’s established editorial style and tone and should provide the same sort of content the publication’s audience typically expects.</span>
